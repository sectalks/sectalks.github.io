## Looking to present?

We are looking for presenters to help kick off the Toowoomba sessions (I'm sure people will eventually get bored if it's just me). 
Please email [toowoomba@sectalks.org](mailto:toowoomba@sectalks.org) if you are interested.

### But I am new to security, can I still join in?

YES! SecTalks is always open to anyone who is keen to learn hands-on infosec.
There will be people willing to mentor you on the day, and you'll be solving CTF's in no time flat.
