## Date & Time 

For June 2016 the meeup will be on the 7th from 6pm. 

On an ongoing basis meetups will be on the second Tuesday of each month (i.e. 12th July will be the next meetup).

## Location 

The venue is King O'Malley's Irish Pub. They are located at 131 City Walk, Canberra. We have a function room booked for the event each month. 

## How to prepare?

1. Bring a laptop along on the night, don't forget your power adapter!
2. Install a VM hypervisor on your laptop. Virtual box is a good free choice. You can download that [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
3. You can either install a VM such as Kali which is free and avaliable [here](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) to work from, or we will have a virtual machine image for you to install on the night.
4. We will have Wi-Fi avaliable, but otherwise you can bring along an ethernet cable for a hardwired connection.
5. People will be more than happy to give you a hand on the night, but be aware there will only be internet you provide avaliable (i.e. phone tethering).

If you rock up with a laptop and a way of running virtual machines you'll be okay to go on the night.
