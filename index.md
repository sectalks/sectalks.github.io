# What
SecTalks meetups are about participating in IT security discussions, learning from others, and improving problem-solving skills.
SecTalks offers an avenue where you can team up with like-minded people to participate in solving technical IT security challenges (i.e. Capture The Flag).

Through SecTalks CTFs, people learn and share solutions. The goal is not to just award winners but to allow people to understand the problems find solutions.

# How

SecTalks has three formats: Talk & long CTF, Talk &
short CTF, and a Ninja Night. Read more [here](./formats).

# Who

SecTalks is a 100% organic voluntary effort, organised by teams of passionate individuals and supported by
a community of great people. It is a community for people with different skillsets e.g. ops, devs, sysadmins, security researchers etc.
