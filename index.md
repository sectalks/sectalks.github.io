# What
SecTalks meetups are about participating in IT security discussions, learning from others, and improving problem-solving skills. 
SecTalks offers an avenue where you can team-up with likeminded people to participate in solving technical IT security challenges (i.e. Capture The Flag).

Through SecTalks CTF people learn and share solutions. The goal is not to just award winners but to allow people understand 
their problem and find a solution.

# How

SecTalks has three formats, Talk & long CTF, Talk &
short CTF, and a Ninja Night. Read more [here](./formats).

# Who

SecTalks is a 100% organic voluntary effort, organised by teams of passionate individuals and supported by
