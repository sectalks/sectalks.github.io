# What
SecTalks meetups are about participating in IT security discussions, learning from others, and improving problem-solving skills. 
SecTalks offers an avenue where you can team-up with likeminded people to participate in solving technical IT security challenges (i.e. Capture The Flag).

Through SecTalks CTF people learn and share solutions. The goal is not to just award winners but to allow people understand 
their problem and find a solution.

# How

short CTF, and a Ninja Night. Read more [here](./formats).
