SYD0x0c (13th session)

Friday, December 4, 2015
6:00 PM

Assembly Bar
Entry via 488 Kent Street, Sydney (map) 

Per the earlier announcement, this is our last meetup of the year. 
It is going to be catch-up, no presentations and (hopefully) we are going to 
give out the details of Christmas CTF to make you busy during the holiday season.

I repeat, this is a catch-up only. You do NOT need to bring along your laptop/CTF gears :-)
