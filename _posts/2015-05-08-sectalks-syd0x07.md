# 1 i <3 runtime tracing

While runtime debugging has existed since breakpoints, this has always been a laborious and difficult process, and one that scales poorly with project size: the bigger the debugging task, the exponentially more time you need to spend identifying areas of interest. This is a technical presentation about a new tool for tracing process execution in Windows environments, and work currently underway in visualising process execution – what it does, how it works, and where it might be applied, including live demos (fingers crossed!).
