So it is this time of the year that people exchange gifts. Giving and getting (!=boring) gifts have been always fun. So why we don't give it a try? With over 300+ members across Australia, there should be enough people who would be keen to share great feelings!

We are in cyber infosec cyber community which makes it more interesting to see your cyber gifts ideas. Is there going to be someone giving out Use-After-Free 0days, teaching a new exploitation method, or a new CTF tactic? It can be also classic gifts such as vouchers for events, mugs, t-shirts, etc. There is no rule, use your own imagination.
