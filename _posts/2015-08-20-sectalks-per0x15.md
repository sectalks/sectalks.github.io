#1 opps - stole ya identity
From access control and confidential invoices to Facebook notifications and
spam, the wealth of personally identifying information sent to your mailbox
is often underrated. In this story I talk about how a simple mistake merged
my identity with another me and how this method could be weaponised to
harvest confidential information.
