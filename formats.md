SecTalks is being held in three formats.

#1. Presentation & monthly CTF

This meetup starts with 15 to 25 minutes a presentation on a technical security topic (no vendor pitch!).
Following with a question and answer. The session continues with description of monthly challenge e.g.
challenge description, rules, how to submit flags etc. 

Participant names will be added to [the team generator script]() and people will be randomly assigned
to different teams to work together in coming month to solve the CTF.

There is also a second presentation but informal for the winning team to go through their solution
of past CTF.

#2. Presentation & 60min CTF

Similar to the first format, this meetup starts with 15 to 25 minutes a presentation on a technical security topic (no vendor pitch!).
Following with a question and answer. The session continues with description of 60min challenge e.g.

Participant names will be added to [the team generator script]() and people will be randomly assigned
to different teams.

60min CTF challenge is presented to all the teams. The objective is to find a flag in less than 60min 
and the first team who solves the challenge will present their solution. 

#3. Ninja night

This is a night where you show off your ninja skills. A typical night goes like this, we rock-up at a pub, 
grab some beers, write our name down, get randomly assigned to a team, mini CTF challenge 
is presented to all the teams, we start doing coolshit and drink more beers. The objective is to find a flag
 in less than 60min and the first team who solves the challenge will be a winner and will 
present their way through the challenge. 

# Who creates a CTF?
The SecTalks CTFs are crowd sourced. This means the winning team has the opportunity to create the next CTF.
This makes CTFs quite fun and evolving over the time.
