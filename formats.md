is presented to all the teams, we start doing cool shit and drink more beers. The objective is to solve the CTF

# FAQ

## Who creates a CTF?
The SecTalks CTFs are crowd sourced. This means the previously winning team has the opportunity to create the next CTF.
This makes CTFs quite fun and keeps them evolving over time.

## How do I randomly generate teams?
Use your imagination & remember your childhood games!
There is also a [python script](../teamgen.py) that you can use to generate random teams.

## What if a team becomes so strong?
Find out who has experience playing CTF before, put them in a separate teams as a team lead.
